"""
A `Rule` object contains the information required to apply some
logical rule to every cell of every timestep of a simulation.

Rules can be chained together sequentially into [`Ruleset`](@ref)s.

Rules are applied to the grid using the [`applyrule`](@ref) method:

```julia
@inline applyrule(data::SimData, rule::YourRule, state, cellindex) =
```

Where cellindex is a `Tuple` of `Int`, and `state` is a single value, or a `NamedTuple`
if multiple grids are requested. The `NamedTuple` keys will match the
keys in `R`, which is a type like `Tuple{:key1,:key1}` - note the names are user
specified, and should never be fixed by a Rule - they can be retrieved from the type
here as `A` and `B` :

```julia
applyrule(data::SimData, rule::YourCellRule{Tuple{R1,R2},Tuple{W1,W2}}, state, cellindex) where {R1,R2,W1,W2}
```

By default the output is written to the current cell in the specified `W` write grid/s.
`Rule`s writing to multiple grids, simply return a `Tuple` in the order specified by
the `W` type params.

## Precalculation

[`precalcrule`](@ref) can be used to precalculate any fields that depend on the
timestep. Otherwise everything should be precalculated apon construction.

Retreive required information from [`SimData`](@ref) such as [`currenttime`](@ref)
or [`currentframe`](@ref). The return value is the updated rule.

```julia
precalcrule(rule::YourCellRule, data::SimData)
```

## Rule Performance

Rules may run many millions of times during a simulation. They need to be fast.

Some basic guidlines for writing rules are:
- Never allocate memory in a `Rule` if you can help it.
- Type stability is essential. [`isinferred`](@ref) is useful to check
  if your rule is type-stable.
- Using the `@inline` macro on `applyrule` can help force inlining your
  code into the simulation.
- Reading and writing from multiple grids is expensive due to additional load
  on fast cahce memory. Try to limit the number of grids you use.

"""
A `Rule` that only writes and uses a state from single cell of the read grids,
and has its return value written back to the same cell(s).

This limitation can be useful for performance optimisation,
such as wrapping rules in [`Chain`](@ref) so that no writes occur between rules.


`CellRule` is defined with :

```julia
struct YourCellRule{R,W} <: CellRule{R,W} end
```

And applied as:

```julia
function applyrule(data::SimData, rule::YourCellRule{R,W}, state, cellindex) where {R,W}
    state * 2
end
```

As the `cellindex` is provided in `applyrule`, you can look up an [`aux`](@ref) array
using `aux(data, Val{:auxname}())[cellindex...]` to access cell-specific variables for
your rule.

It's good to add a struct field to hold the `Val{:auxname}()` object instead of
using names directly, so that users can set the aux name themselves to suit the
scripting context.

"""
abstract type CellRule{R,W} <: Rule{R,W} end

"""
`SetCellRule` is the supertype for rules that manually write to whichever cells of the
grid that they choose, instead of automatically updating every cell with their output.

`SetCellRule` is applied with a method like:

```julia
function applyrule!(data::SimData, rule::YourSetCellRule{R,W}, state, cellindex) where {R,W}
     inc = 1
     add!(data[W], inc, cellindex...)
     return nothing
end
```

Note the `!` bang - this method alters the state of `data`. We also use the type
parameter `W` (write) to index into the `data` object. You could also just use
`first(dat)` when there is only one `W` write grid.

To update the grid, you can use: [`add!`](@ref), [`sub!`](@ref) for `Number`,
and [`and!`](@ref), [`or!`](@ref) for `Bool`. These methods safely combined
writes from all grid cells - directly using `setindex!` would cause bugs.

It there are multiple write grids, you will need to get the grid keys from
type parameters, here `W1` and `W2`:

```julia
function applyrule(data, rule::YourManRule{R,Tuple{W1,W2}}, state, cellindex) where {R,W1,W2}
     inc = 1
     add!(data[W1], inc, cellindex...)
     add!(data[W2], 2inc, cellindex...)

A Rule that only accesses a neighborhood centered around the current cell.
`NeighborhoodRule` is applied with the method:

```julia
applyrule(data::SimData, rule::YourNeighborhoodRule, state, I)
```

`NeighborhoodRule` must have a `neighborhood` field, that holds
a [`Neighborhood`](@ref) object. `neighbors(rule)` returns an iterator
over the surrounding cell pattern defined by the `Neighborhood`.

For each cell in the grids the neighborhood buffer will be updated
for use in the `applyrule` method, managed to minimise array reads.

This allows memory optimisations and the use of BLAS routines on the
neighborhood buffer for [`Moore`](@ref) neighborhoods. It also means
that and no bounds checking is required in neighborhood code.

For neighborhood rules with multiple read grids, the first is always
the one used for the neighborhood, the others are passed in as additional
state for the cell. Any grids can be written to, but only for the current cell.

optimisations. Best suited to simple functions like `rand`(write)` or using convolutions

As with all [`NeighborhoodRule`](@ref), you do not have to check bounds at

Using [`SparseOpt`](@ref) may improve neighborhood performance
when zero values are common and can be safely ignored.
