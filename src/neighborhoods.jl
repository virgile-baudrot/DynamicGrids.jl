Neighborhoods define the pattern of surrounding cells in the "neighborhood"
of the current cell. The `neighbors` function returns the surrounding
cells as an iterable.

The main kinds of neighborhood are demonstrated below:

![Neighborhoods](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cesaraustralia/DynamicGrids.jl/media/Neighborhoods.png)

If the allocation of neighborhood buffers during the simulation is costly
(it usually isn't) you can use `allocbuffers` or preallocate them:

```julia
Moore{3}(allocbuffers(3, init))
```

You can also change the length of the buffers tuple to
experiment with cache performance.
